# User-Facing Technical Writing Samples

This repository contains a curated collection of user-facing technical writing samples,
focused on explaining technical concepts and workflows in a clear and accessible way.

The materials are designed for non-expert users, beginners, and product users.
The original articles are published in Russian. Each entry includes an English summary
to provide context and highlight the scope and intent of the material.

## What Is Git and How Version Control Works

This article introduces Git and version control systems from the ground up, explaining
why they are used and how they help developers work with code safely and efficiently.
It covers core concepts such as repositories, commits, branches, and version history,
focusing on the mental model behind Git rather than command memorization. The article
is written for beginners who have never worked with version control before.
The material can be used for onboarding documentation, learning materials, or
user-facing guides explaining basic development tools.

## How APIs Work: Understanding REST APIs

This article explains what APIs are and how they enable different programs to
communicate with each other, using REST APIs as a practical example.
It focuses on core concepts such as requests, responses, HTTP methods, and data formats,
without requiring backend development experience. Real-world analogies and examples
are used to make abstract ideas easier to understand.
The material is suitable for product documentation, introductory technical guides,
and onboarding content for users interacting with API-based services.

## How APIs Are Tested: Tools and Workflows

This article explains how developers test APIs to ensure they work correctly,
using REST APIs as a practical example.
It introduces common testing approaches and tools such as curl, Postman, and Python-based
requests, focusing on workflows rather than automation frameworks. The article shows
how API responses are inspected, validated, and debugged in practice.
The material can be used in onboarding documentation, product support materials,
or guides explaining API usage and reliability.
